<li>Hi! I’m Bobby.</li>
<li>The presentation I’m about to give is about death and rebirth mechanics in video games. I’m leading with that because death and thoughts thereof regularly have profound impacts on the living, and any of you dealing with those thoughts should be allowed to choose whether or not you expose yourself to more. If it helps you make a more educated decision, I’m going to be talking mostly about how player death is handled in Mario and Dark Souls, nothing to do with their narratives. So, if you don’t feel up to hearing it, you don’t have to. My presentation is not worth more than your mental health. If you feel the need to leave, please do so.</li>
<li>Ready? Let’s get started</li>
<li>Video games use death and rebirth in their mechanics regularly</li>
<li>Unfortunately, more focus is generally put on the death half, and less on the rebirth half.
<ul>
<li>Look at COD.</li>
<li>And Battlefield</li>
<li>And Mass Effect</li>
<li>And the Mario games</li>
<li>And if I were left alone to ramble, I could probably go for hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But I’ve only got 5 minutes, so…</li>
<li>Let’s take the most well known game listed above, Mario.
<ul>
<li>When you take a hit too many in a Mario game, things go like this:
<ol>
<li>A short tableau that makes it abundantly clear Mario is dead plays as the screen fades to black.</li>
<li>If the number of lives you have remaining is greater than zero, that number appears onscreen and gets reduced by 1.</li>
<li>a. The game then reloads with Mario at the last checkpoint the player passed as if nothing has happened.</li>
<li>If that number was zero, even sadder music plays as the words “Game Over” appear on screen above some buttons saying “Continue” and “Quit”.</li>
<li>a. If you’re playing a very old Mario game, the next time you play, the game will start over.</li>
<li>b. If you’re in a newer one, you’ll end up on the level select screen just outside the level you died in, with an arbitrary number of lives to try again.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This is extremely simplistic and not very interesting.
<ul>
<li>Player death has no impact on the game world as a whole.</li>
<li>It just serves as a minor inconvenience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That’s not entirely a bad thing though.
<ul>
<li>Specifically, that simplicity was important to the people designing the original Super Mario Bros. since it was released at a time when few people knew what video games were and how they worked.</li>
<li>Making death easy to understand made their game more accessible to new players at a time when almost all of their players were new to video games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But it’s 2015 now. Video games have been a critical part of many of our living rooms for decades.</li>
<li>We can do better.</li>
<li>And we have!
<ul>
<li>Most recently, <em>Undertale</em> took the world by storm in part because Toby Fox made death and rebirth an important part of the game’s story.</li>
<li>But most famously, <em>Dark Souls</em> made death <em>and rebirth</em> important in the <em>game mechanics</em>.
<ul>
<li>To understand how this was done, you need to know about 2 things: souls and bonfires.</li>
<li>Souls are currency and experience points combined. You get souls every time you defeat an enemy, and you can use them to purchase upgrades and items. How many you are carrying is shown in the bottom right corner of the screen.</li>
<li>Bonfires are places where you can sit to replenish you character’s health and certain items, but they also reset all of the world’s enemies when you sit at them. This is important.</li>
<li>When you die, initially it looks just like Mario:
<ol>
<li>A short death animation, “You Died” in big menacing red letters across the screen, fade to black.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This is where things change.
<ol start="2">
<li>There is no life counter. Once loading is done, the game fades back in to your character standing up from the last bonfire they’d sat at before they died, with zero souls.</li>
<li>In your absence, all the enemies have reset, because as I mentioned, that’s what happens when you sit at bonfires.</li>
<li>Finally, there is now a sparkly glowing green thing hovering near the place you died.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>That is what separates <em>Dark Souls</em> from <em>Mario</em>. That green thing contains all the souls you just lost, and if you get back there without dying, you can retrieve them.</li>
<li>This <strong>is</strong> interesting.
<ul>
<li>Now, a player’s death has a noticeable impact on the world that’s visible on their next attempt.</li>
<li>Plus, it manages to be a major inconvenience to the player without instantly crushing all their hopes and dreams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the same time, it isn’t perfect.
<ul>
<li>Understanding death in <em>Dark Souls</em> requires much more knowledge of the game’s mechanics than death in <em>Mario</em> does.</li>
<li>That makes it far less approachable for new players, as evidenced by the 30 painful hours I spent trying to get by a single early boss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So, that’s about all I have to say. I had to leave a whole bunch out for time, so if you’re interested in any of this (especially <em>Undertale</em>), go look it up. If you’re interested in game design in general, go check out the amazing  YouTube channel Extra Credits and Mark Brown’s excellent Game Maker’s Toolkit series. They were both really helpful to me while writing this.</li>
<li>Any questions?</li>
